I find listening to podcasts to be an excellent way to keep up to date with the latest news and learn about new subjects.  As someone who walks a lot, I find being able to download and listen to podcasts on my phone a great feature.  You can subscribe to shows to keep you up-to-date with the latest episodes, though not every subject is going to be of interest to you, in which case just skip the episodes.

## Recommended technical podcasts

* [JavaScript Air](https://javascriptair.com/){{ site.new_tab }}

Finished now (last episode 18th Oct 2016) but definitely worth going through as they had a lot of interesting episodes and guests such as Brendan Eich, Dan Abramov and Kyle Simpson.

Short podcasts, usually less than 20 minutes, that concentrate on the non-technical side of your career.

## Software for managing podcasts

For Android I use [Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict){{ site.new_tab }} you can subscribe to podcasts, download episodes, and vary playback speeds (tip - try listening at higher speeds, such as 1.5x you will quickly get used to the speed).
