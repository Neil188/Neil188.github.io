Hi!  I'm a JavaScript developer, living in Gateshead.  I've been working in IT for over 18 years, at QSP on Team Valley, then British Airways on Newcastle Business Park, working with a variety of technologies including COBOL, DB2, Visual Basic and Oracle. I've worked in application support and development, covering everything from day-to-day support, solutions design, end-to-end testing and config management.

I left British Airways in 2016 in order to start learning web development, wanting to start on a new path in my career.  I've found I really enjoy Javascript and love how passionate and generous some of its supporters are in the community.  The number of high quality, free resources that are available always amazes me, and I would love to be able to do my bit to help new starters.

Away from computers I love coffee, reading, photography and walking.  I obsess about hitting my daily [Fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com/user/2356X5) step count, I'm happiest finding a local nature park to go walking around (tracking the walk using [Endomondo](https://www.endomondo.com/profile/4810698)), where I can take photos using my phone (pictures stored on my [Flikr account](https://www.flickr.com/people/neillupton/)).

## Give blood!

If you are in the UK, and able to, I urge you to consider giving blood - [visit NHS Blood and Transplant](https://www.blood.co.uk/).  I've done 26 donations so far, and have always found it an easy and painless process, so if you haven't gone before please consider it, the staff are always extremely friendly and will guide you through the process without any pressure.
