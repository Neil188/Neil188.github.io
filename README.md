# Neil188.github.io - personal blog

Built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator, using [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) as the starting point.

Hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Local Development - Windows

To run a Jekyll build locally you will first need to install Ruby - [Ruby Installer for Windows](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) is a good source for this, download and run the latest Ruby+Devkit 2.5.X (x64) installer.

Next, install Jekyll and the GitHub pages plug-ins using `gem install github-pages`.

Now start the Jekyll server using `jekyll serve`, which will generate the static site and start a local server at 127.0.0.1:4000.

when your site is ready and you commit to GitHub, then GitHub will automatically run the build to regenerate the latest version of your site.
